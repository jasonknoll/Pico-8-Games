# Pico-Games
Games &amp; toy software I've made for the [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and [Picotron](https://www.lexaloffle.com/picotron.php). 

Cartridges made for Pico-8 have the `*.p8` file extension while Picotron uses `*.p64`. Simply load these into your machine and play away!
