# Pico-8 & Picotron Metronome
Simple metronome applications made in both Pico-8 (\*.p8) and Picotron (\*.p64).

The idea is to make an example metronome (to practice for my Android app) in both Pico-8/-tron. Pico allows for binary and web exporting and I would love to officially "release" some software, even if it's made in Pico.

All it has to do is display the tempo, play a click sound to that tempo, and light up some shapes (circles?) in time with the click sound.
